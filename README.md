## Getting Your Rebate: The Simple Way

Here's the thing about referral codesâ€”they're only useful if you actually know how to apply them. Let me walk you through this:

First, head over to the OKX Exchange website. You'll see a sign-up form waiting for you. In the referral code field, drop in **47044926**. That's your ticket to the discount.

Hit that "Sign Up" button and fill in your details. Email, password, the usual stuff. Nothing fancy here.

Once you're in, your partner dashboard becomes your new best friend. This is where you'll find your unique referral linkâ€”the one you'll share with anyone who asks "which exchange should I use?"

Every time someone clicks your link and actually starts trading, you start earning. Not someday. Not after they hit some massive volume. Daily commissions land in your account based on what your referrals are paying in fees.

The math is straightforward: more active referrals = more money back in your pocket. Some folks see this as a side hustle. Others just appreciate the fees they save on their own trades.

## What's Actually in Your Wallet?

Let's talk numbers. The rebate rate goes up to 20% of the trading fees your referrals generate. That percentage isn't fixed thoughâ€”it scales with volume.

Think about it this way: if someone you referred trades $10,000 worth of crypto and pays $10 in fees, you're looking at up to $2 back. Now multiply that by multiple active traders over weeks and months. It adds up faster than you'd expect.

## Setting Up Your Account (No Headaches Required)

Ready to actually get started? Here's the play-by-play:

Click through to OKX Exchange. The "Sign Up" button is right thereâ€”you can't miss it.

Type in your email and create a password. Pro tip: make it something you'll remember but others won't guess.

Click "Sign Up" again to confirm. Check your inbox for the verification email (might take a minute or two).

Verify that email address. This step is non-negotiableâ€”exchanges take security seriously for good reason.

Once verified, you're in. Log in and you've got full access to spot trading, margin trading, derivativesâ€”the whole lineup.

OKX Exchange has been around long enough to prove it's not going anywhere. The platform handles serious volume daily, offers some of the lowest fees you'll find anywhere, and actually has customer support that responds when things go sideways.

The rebate program is basically free money for something you'd probably do anywayâ€”recommend a solid exchange to friends who ask.
